Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful class of deep generative models, achieving state-of-the-art results in image generation, audio synthesis, protein design, and many scientific domains. Notable works in the literature include [Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585), [Ho et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239), [Song et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456), and [Karras et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364). This introduction explains the core idea of diffusion models as flows generated by a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) and walks through a full example of how to sample an 11-component Gaussian mixture data starting from a standard normal initial distribution. The full codes can be found [here](https://github.com/bachvietdo01/generative_models/tree/main/diffusion_model).
