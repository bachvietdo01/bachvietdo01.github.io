Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful class of deep generative models, achieving state-of-the-art results in image generation, audio synthesis, protein design, and many scientific domains. Notable works in the literature include [Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585), [Ho et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239), [Song, Ermon et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600), [Song, Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456), and [Karras et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364). 

This introduction explains the core idea of diffusion models as flows generated by a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) and walks through a full example of how to sample an 11-component Gaussian mixture data starting from a standard normal initial distribution. The full codes can be found [here](https://github.com/bachvietdo01/generative_models/tree/main/diffusion_model).


## Stochastic Flows by SDE

A common view of diffusion models is learning to reverse a forward process that progressively diffuse data into noise. However, they can also be seen as a stochastic counterpart to flow matching models (see Holderrieth et al., 2025). [Flow matching](https://bachvietdo01.github.io/intro-to-flow-matching-models) describes flows generated by an ODE: $\frac{dX_t}{dt} = u_t(X_t)$. In contrast, diffusion models are stochastic flows, the solutions to the below Stochastic Differential Equation:

$$
\begin{align}
dX_t = u_t(X_t)dt + \frac{\sigma_t^2}{2} \cdot \nabla \log p_t(X_t) dt + \sigma_t d W_t \quad (1)
\end{align}
$$

Here, $X_t \sim p_t(\cdot)$ traces the marginal probability path, $u_t(X_t)$ is the deterministic vector field, $\sigma_t^2$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $W_t$ denotes Brownian motion. Personally, I find the SDE perspective more intuitive and rigorous.

</p>

The SDE $(1)$ implies that for sufficiently small $h > 0$, 

$$
\begin{align}
X_{t+h} = X_t + h\cdot u_t + h \cdot \frac{\sigma_t^2}{2} \nabla \log p_t(X_t) + \sqrt{h} \cdot N(\cdot \mid 0 \\; , \\; I).
\end{align}
$$

The last term, $\sqrt{h} \cdot N(\cdot \mid 0 \\; , \\; I)$, is the outcome of taking a small changes of Brownian Motion $dW_t$.

## Construct Conditional and Marginal Probability Path

<em>Gaussian Conditionn path converges to data point z as time t goes to 1</em>
</p>

As in the Flow Matching setup, given data samples $z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n \sim p_{\text{data}}$, we define a conditional probability path $p_0(\cdot \mid z), \ldots, p_t(\cdot \mid z), \ldots, p_1(\cdot \mid z)$. A common choice is a conditional Gaussian: $p_t(\cdot \mid z) := \mathcal{N}(\cdot \mid \alpha_t z \\;, \\; \beta_t^2 I)$, where $\alpha_t \to 1$ and $\beta_t^2 \to 0$ as $t \to 1$.

As shown in the Flow Matching introduction, this defines a deterministic flow solving the ODE $\frac{dX_t}{dt} = u_t(X_t \mid z)$ with
$u_t(x \mid z) = \left(\dot{\alpha}_t - \frac{\dot{\beta}_t}{\beta_t} \alpha_t \right) z + \frac{\dot{\beta}_t}{\beta_t} x$.

Using Bayes’ rule, the marginal distribution is $p_t(x) = \int p_t(x \mid z) p_{\text{data}}(z), dz$. It can be shown that $u_t$ and $p_t$ satisfy the **Fokker–Planck equation**, and by Theorem 15 of Holderrieth et al. (2025), if $X_t$ solves the SDE $(1)$, then $X_t$ follows a marginal probability path with $X_1 \sim p_{\text{data}}$.
