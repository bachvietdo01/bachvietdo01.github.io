Hi there! I'm Bach, a Machine Learning Research Scientist at Meta. My background is in mathematics and statistics, shaped through my time at Columbia University and the University of Michigan. Over the years, I’ve immersed myself in the world of theorems, equations, and algorithms—unpacking the nuances and uncovering the mysteries of modern statistics and the ever-evolving field of machine learning. Since you're here, I hope you enjoy reading some of my writing.
