**Flow Matching** (Lipman et al., 2023) is a powerful class of generative models behind systems like [Stable Diffusion 3](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3) and [Metagen](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/flow-matching-guide-and-code/), capable of generating highly realistic images and videos. This gentle introduction covers the core ideas behind Flow Matching and walks through a complete example of using Flow Matching models to sample from an 11-component multivariate Gaussian mixture, starting from an initial standard Gaussian distribution. For those interested in practical applications, stay tuned for upcoming posts where we’ll use these same techniques to build a Flow Matching generative model for sampling MNIST images. You can find the code for this post [here](https://github.com/bachvietdo01/generative_models/tree/main/flow_matching).



## It's all about the vector field

The key idea of [Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747) is to construct a probability flow — a path $X_0, \ldots, X_t, \ldots, X_1$ over time index $t \in [0, 1]$ — where  $X_0$ is sampled from an initial distribution $p_{\text{init}}$ and $X_1$ comes from the target distribution $p_{\text{data}}(\cdot)$. This path is a solution to the following ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation), 

$$\begin{align} 
\cfrac{d}{dt} X_t(x) = u_t(x) \\quad (1)&
\end{align}$$  

where $u_t(x)$ is the vector field and $X_t(x)$ a trajectory for location $x$ at time $t$. Formally, the solution to ODE $(1)$ is called flows, with each flow corresponding to a different initial point. We can also say vector field $u_t(x)$ generates flow $X_t(x)$ as demonstrated in the below figure.

Intuitively, the vector field $u_t(x)$ generates flows, as for a small $h$, the ODE $(1) imples that $X_{t+h} = X_t + h \cdot u_t$. If the target data is drawn from $p_{\text{data}}(\cdot)$, there exists a vector field that transports samples from an initial distribution, typically a standard Gaussian $N(0, I)$, to $p_{\text{data}}$. The main goal of Flow Matching is to learn or estimate the target vector field $u_t(x)$ using a neural network.

## Gaussian Probability Path

To reiterate, given a data sample $z_1, \ldots, z_n \sim p_{\text{data}}(\cdot)$, the Flow Matching model aims to construct a probability path $p_t(\cdot)$ such that $X_0 \sim p_{\text{init}}(\cdot), \ldots, X_t \sim p_t(\cdot), \ldots, X_1 \sim p_{\text{data}}(\cdot)$. However, directly building this path from the marginal $p_{\text{data}}$ is highly challenging. To address this, Lipman proposed first constructing a Gaussian conditional path $p_t(x \mid z)$,

$$\begin{align}
p_t( x | z) = N(x | \alpha_t z \\; , \\; \beta_t^2 \cdot I)&
\end{align}
$$

where the nosie scheduler $\alpha_t = t$ and $\beta_t^2 = 1 -t$ and data point $z \sim p_{\text{data}}(\cdot)$.

By definition, we see that $p_0(\cdot) = p_{\text{init}}(\cdot) = N(\cdot \mid 0, I)$ and $p_1(\cdot) = \delta_z$. In other words, the conditional probability path $p_t(\cdot | z)$ starts from $p_\text{init}$ and converges to the data point $z$ as $t \to 1$.
