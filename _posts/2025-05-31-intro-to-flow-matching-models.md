## It's all about the vector field

Flow Matching is a powerful class of generative models behind systems like Stable Diffusion 3 and Metagen, capable of generating highly realistic images and videos. The key idea is to construct a probability flow — a path \( X_0, \ldots, X_t, \ldots, X_1 \) over time \( t \in [0, 1] \) — where \( X_0 \) is sampled from an initial distribution \( p_{\text{init}} \), and \( X_1 \) comes from the target distribution \( p_{\text{data}}(\cdot) \).
