**Flow Matching** is a powerful class of generative models behind systems like Stable [Diffusion 3](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3) and [Metagen](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/flow-matching-guide-and-code/), capable of generating highly realistic images and videos. This gentle introduction covers the core ideas behind Flow Matching and walks through a complete example of using Flow Matching models to sample from an 11-component multivariate Gaussian mixture, starting from an initial standard Gaussian distribution. For those interested in practical applications, stay tuned for upcoming posts where we’ll use these same techniques to build a Flow Matching generative model for sampling MNIST images.

## It's all about the vector field

The key idea is to construct a probability flow — a path $X_0, \ldots, X_t, \ldots, X_1$ over time index $t \in [0, 1]$ — where  $X_0$ is sampled from an initial distribution $p_{\text{init}}$ and $X_1$ comes from the target distribution $p_{\text{data}}(\cdot)$.  This path is a solution to the following ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation), 

$$\begin{aligned} X_t(x) = u_t(x) \end{aligned}$$  where $u_t(x)$ is the vector field for location $x$ at time $t$. Formally, the solution to ODE $(1)$ is called flows, with each flow corresponding to a different initial point.
